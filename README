The application provides the required functionality described on the following page:
https://bitbucket.org/one-way/blackswan-tests/src/master/bs-mid-to-senior-java-dev.md

The application can be built and executed using the "docker build . -t users-with-tasks"
(assuming the current folder equals to the root folder of the app) and the
"docker run -p 8080:8080 users-with-tasks" commands respectively.
Once the application started, it can be accessed with HTTP protocol on the 8080 port,
authentication is not required.

The application runs with "local" profile, it is hard coded into the Dockerfile.
Although technically the app could run with several other profiles too (dev, test, prod),
there are no valid DB connection details in the respective property files.

The used DB is H2, the schema is generated by Liquibase. The only prerequisite is
to have a /tmp folder on the executor machine.

Javadoc has been added to all of the classes and their public methods.

Unit tests have been created for the necessary classes.
